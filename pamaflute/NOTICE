The modifications made in the derivative work 
relate to refactoring the example originally adapted from
https://github.com/sergiocorreia/panflute/blob/master/docs/source/index.rst
into a compilable text file "increase_header_level.pama" (expressed in
the language of pyPMatch), and a python program "increase_header_level.py" 
that:
* translates the .pama file; and 
* applies the resulting code to implement the original panflute filter.
